Hard Drives
===========

- recording
    - 4TB: WD4000FYYZ: £253.74
    - RAID 1 system
    
- processing
    - 1TB: WD1003FBYX: £67.99 
    - not back upped
    - because the lab computers I use for processing do not have enough power to keep 2RAID with minimal efford
    - data will be transferred to a 4TB RAID1 after processing
        - that mean the entire dataset can be stored on a single physical disk
        
Video Conversion
================

Converting from H264 to FFV1

::
    ffmpeg -i 2013-06-10.14-15-00.mp4 -vcodec ffv1 -qscale 0 2013-06-10.14-15-00.avi
    
Converting video into image sequence each frame an image

::
    ffmpeg -i 2013-06-10.14-15-00.mp4 -vsync 0 -s hd480 -f image2 image15-%05d.png    
    
Quantitative Evaluation of Video Capture
========================================

- got counter from the electrical engineering dept
- preliminary results of testing of old pipeline:
    - framerate stable (just tested with a single video)
    - one second loss between two videos

Rebuild of Capturing Environment with GStreamer 1.0
===================================================

- dynamically changing pipeline while in RUNNING
    - http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/manual/html/section-dynamic-pipelines.html (19.4.1)
    
- Gstreamer 1.1.1 released a few days ago. Should wait until stable release 1.2.x is released, which is hopefully in a few weeks
