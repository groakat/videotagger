IPython notebook and reveal
###########################

Newer IPythons integrate a Cell Toolbar --> Slideshow 

Allows to divide cells into slides and subslides. These can then be converted with 

.. code-block:: bash

    python nbconvert.py reveal reveal-test.ipynb
    
Problems with local content
===========================

IPython notebook requires to prepend local paths with 'files/' while HTML does not want that. Therefore before using `nbconvert` one has to remove those prefixes.

IPython parallel
################

Debugging on engines, by starting a qtconsole directly on the remote worker:

.. code-block:: python

    %%px
    from IPython.parallel import bind_kernel
    bind_kernel()
    
    rc[0].execute("%qtconsole")

Fly behaviour project
=====================
* CVPR deadline in November
* topic: cost sensitive learning for "easy examples" 
    * show that it is possible to learn with less human cost if MIL is used 
    * show that labelling boundaries is more costly than labelling centers of action
    * (maybe similarities with image segmentation from strokes)
* we need a method to estimate the user time spend for a certain part/frame of the movie

Fly Climbin Project
===================
* should produce a paper
* is interesting, however should have a lower priority than main project
* maybe counting flies could be another source for Dominics counting
