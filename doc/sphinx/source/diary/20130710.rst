Yesterday and today: setting up of cluster computers

* Relatively straight forward using Fedora
* only problem is the use of pip install -r requirements
    * numpy and cython have to get installed before requirements.txt can be installed
    * numba and related were commented out and not installed
    
* tiny incident:
    * one power supply unit melted during setup (was replaced, but makes stability of others questionable)
    
Startup precedure on each cluster
#################################

* mount source and destination hard drives
* start ssh as root

.. code-block:: bash

    # /sbin/service sshd start
    
* start virtual environment in ~/code/pyTools

.. code-block:: bash

    $ source pyToolsEnv/bin/activate
    
* start screen

.. code-block:: bash

    $ screen -S batch
    
* start script

Batch installation of gstreamer plugins
#######################################

After installing gstreamer and copying the gstreamer/scripts/gst-uninstalled to ~/bin/gst-sth and modifying the root path in it, the gstreamer plugins can all be compiled with:

By using expect

.. code-block:: bash

    #!/usr/bin/expect
    
    set timeout -1
    
    foreach i {gst-plugins-base gst-plugins-good gst-plugins-bad gst-plugins-ugly gst-python gnonlin gst-ffmpeg} {
        spawn gst-gst2
        expect "$ "
        send "git clone git://cgit.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/$i\r"
        expect "$ "
        send "cd ./$i\r"
        expect "$ "
        send "./autogen.sh\r"
        expect "$ "
        send "make -j7\r"
        expect "$ "
        send "exit\r"
    }
