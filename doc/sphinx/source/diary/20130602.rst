make annoView more responsive
################################

- setting scale in updateGraphicView made it get so slow that annoView block trajectory plots
- adding new annotations onto scene rather than clearing scene completely and readding all elements speeds the annoView up in the transition between files
- 100ms possible without the lag of 0.07sec at each transition
- tried to prefetch and build elements of scene in separate thread: failed, took longer to copy the data
- an alternative approach would be to have two scenes which are swapped like framebuffers
- having three annoViews should work, however it seems that the annotationDict is shared between them which leads to crashed when it is deleted and even interferences before.
