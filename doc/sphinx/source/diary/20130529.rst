Meeting with Gabe and Mike
==========================

GUI
###

Mike:
    - get input from future users
    - make comparison possible by displaying similar video sequences next to each other
        - this could be previously annotated sequences
        - this could be sequences with similar feature vector
        - maybe even a combination of both
        
Gabe:
    - make focus on one vial possible
    - it is important for the MIL to get perfectly clean negative bags

Additional conclusions:
    - ask user to verify negative video sequences before using for MIL
    
    
Implementation
==============

*annotation*:
    - implemented filter that is capable of generating new annotation instances with the filtered content
    
*annotation visualization*
    - implemented blockwise visualization for QGraphicsView
