Implementation of AnnotationView
=================================

- it is possible to show/ filter an annotation loaded from a file
- I can add framewise annotation

However 

- at the moment the filtering is done in the GUI thread which leads to enormous lags
    - filtering should be done in the video-loader thread
- jumps within file names have to be accounted for there are huge lags at the moment, as well as an KeyError
    
- although not a great challenge once addition of annotations is working, deletion is not implemented yet

Still need to think about a nice way to display the annotation within the GUI. Autosave of annotation files needs to be done

Ideas
=====

GUI

- allow rejustification of annotation boundaries by clicking via mouse (click and drag with mouse)
    - during click, show preview of neighbouring frames
    - if the mouse is moved during the click, the center (displayed frame) will change as well
    
- allow only one annotation at a time, but allow to put bookmarks even if one annotation was started already
