Other python toolkits as alternative to matplotlib

- amazing parallized plots: http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python_Scripting

Problems
========

- parallelization for plotting the trails has memory leak


Observations from trails
========================

- Mail from Matt -> Carlos might be interested
- Interesting things happen:
    - flies seem to return after exploration to initial position
    - Alzheimer flies dont do that
